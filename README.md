# pointSpectra
pointSpectra is low-cost, open-source solution for measuring absorbance of the analyte at specific wavelength of light. This project is initially make for the usecase of detecting snake venom using gold nanoparticles in human blood.

# Hardware requirements
- [Arduino nano](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano) or [any small form factor arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/boards-modules)
- [Tx and Rx boards](https://github.com/HemanthSabbella/pointSpectra/tree/main/pointSpectra%20V1.0)

# Mechanical and glasstube requirements
- [3D-printed case](https://github.com/HemanthSabbella/pointSpectra/tree/main/3D%20printed%20casing)
- A glass testtuve of diameter 5mm(?)
